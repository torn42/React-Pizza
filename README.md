# Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## What I Learned and Implemented

### React Concepts and Techniques:
1. **React Hooks and Higher Order Functions**:
   - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `memo`, `lazy`, conditional rendering, etc.

### Functionality Implemented:
1. **Pagination**: Efficiently manage large sets of data by dividing them into pages.
2. **Sorting**: Implement various sorting mechanisms to organize data.
3. **Search Items**: Implement search functionality to filter items.
4. **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Ensure seamless navigation without full page reloads.
5. **Debounce**: Optimize performance by limiting the rate of function execution.
6. **Adding Items to Cart**: Enable users to add items to a shopping cart.
7. **Data Fetching**: Retrieve data from the backend using Redux Toolkit (RTK).
8. **Rendering Optimization**: Improve performance through various optimization techniques.
9. **Local Storage**: Save and retrieve data from local storage.
10. **Popup Window**: Implement modal windows for additional interactions.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
1. **React**: For building the user interface.
2. **React Router DOM**: For handling routing within the application.
3. **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
4. **Lodash**: For utility functions.
5. **Typescript**: For type checking and improving code quality.
6. **SCSS/CSS Modules**: For styling.
7. **BEM**: For naming conventions in CSS.
8. **Axios**: For making HTTP requests.
9. **Prettier**: For code formatting.
10. **React Content Loader**: For skeleton screens to improve user experience during data loading.
